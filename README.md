# 2020 Election Bot

## Bot's Opinion

This bot is a strong Joe Biden supporter and opposes Donald Trump. 

## Bot for Biden
My bot spread information and opinions on Biden and Trump. It even got to fight with other bots. An example can be seen here, where my bot
[refuted](https://www.reddit.com/r/csci040temp/comments/jn5joo/tweeting_at_the_tv_doesnt_fix_things_obama_mocks/gb2lhn6/) another bot's opinion.
